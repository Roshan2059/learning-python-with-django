# To Concatenate string we should use , or + operator
# example:
# a = "Hi!"
# b = "I am Roshan"
# c = a + b
# print(c)

# we cannot concatenate a number and string
# if we take integer type input from user and try to concatenate it with the string then the program will throw an error this is because we cannot concatenate a number and a string
# for this we have to explicitly change the type of the variable
# example:
# a = int(input("Enter your age:"))
# print("Your age is: " + str(a)) 

# We can also take input from user:
# To take a input from user we should use a function called "input()"
# example:
# a = input()
# print(a)

# To take input from the users with some instructions we have to write some text inside the input() function
# Example:
# age = input("Enter your age:")
# print(age)

# By default the number which is given by the user is in the form of string 
# i.e. in the above example we can literally type the input hello
# note: run the above example and type hello
# The statement will run without any error this is because the input given by the user is in the form of string by default

# So in order to take the input other than the string format i.e. int or float, then we have to explicitly define the data type enclosing the input() function
# example:
# age = int(input("Enter your age:"))
# print(age)

# per = float(input("Enter your percentage:"))
# print(per)

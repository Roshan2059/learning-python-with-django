There are generally 4 main data type:
 They are:
 1. Integer
 eg: a = 20
 2. float
 eg: b = 10.5
 3. boolean
 eg: c = True
 4. String
 eg: d = "Hello world"
 The string can be either enclosed in double quotes or single quotes

 To know the data type of the constant there is a function called "type()"
 Example:
 a = 10
 print(type(a))

 ** --> power
 // --> floor division only prints the whole number

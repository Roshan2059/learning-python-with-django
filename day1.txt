#There are generally 4 main data type:
# They are:
# 1. Integer
# eg: a = 20
# 2. float
# eg: b = 10.5
# 3. boolean
# eg: c = True
# 4. String
# eg: d = "Hello world"
# The string can be either enclosed in double quotes or single quotes

# To know the data type of the constant there is a function called "type()"
# Example:
# a = 10
# print(type(a))

# ** --> power
# // --> floor division only prints the whole number

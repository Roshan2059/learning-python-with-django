Loop:
There are only two loops in python:
for loop and
while loop

for loop:
syntax:
for i in range(1):
  //Code

range is a function in python
range can have 1-3 parameters which has their own meaning:
# range(5) --> 0,1,2,3,4  for(i = 0; i < 5; i++)
# range(1,5) --> 1,2,3,4  for(i = 0; i < 5; i++)
# range(1,5,2) --> 1,3  for (i = 0; i < 5; i = i + 2)

if there is one parameter it means start from zero and end at parameter-1

if there is two parameter it means start from first-parameter and end at second-parameter

if there is three parameter it means start from first-parameter, end at second-parameter and update the values by third-parameter
